# Roadmap

Tableland is building with the [progressive decentralization](https://variant.fund/writing/progressive-decentralization-a-playbook-for-building) playbook. While the principals therein are most often applied to _decentralized apps_, they also make sense for a _decentralized network_ like Tableland that builds off existing blockchains:

1. Product/market fit
2. Community participation
3. Sufficient decentralization (community ownership)

We have learned a lot about building developer tooling at [Textile](https://textile.io): [ThreadDB](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads) ([whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/gu3ywqi)), [Buckets](https://github.com/textileio/textile), [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate), and [BidBot](https://github.com/textileio/bidbot). Tableland has huge ambitions, but we are initially focusing on validating our UX/DX assumptions and adapting our approach as needed. There is always more to learn and we‚Äôre here for the long haul!

The first half of 2022 will be dedicated to steps (1) and (2). We‚Äôll release a _gateway_ at [EthDenver 2022](https://www.ethdenver.com) with tables anchored to Rinkeby testnet. The Gateway will feel a lot like the future network, except that in the future table minting will include a deposit for _table gas_. This approach will allow developers to explore the possibilities of Tableland as we work on the underlying protocol in parallel.

Join our Discrod to take part in the process and stay tuned as we roll out plans over the next few weeks, and read on for a high-level overview of our current plans.

### Q1 2022: Tableland is born with a simple API

1. Announce the Tableland project at EthDenver! Come say hello at our booth. We‚Äôll be hosting a workshop and giving a talk about Tableland.
2. Allow partners and EthDenver hackers to explore Tableland using the Gateway.

### Q2 2022: A surprise, access control, and additional table ownership models

1. A surprise! We have been working on something special for the community üôá‚ù§Ô∏è.
2. Release support for SQL privileges (`GRANT` and `REVOKE`).
3. Release support for table row security policies.
4. Release support for ERC721-based table ownership.

## Q3, Q4, and beyond

_Stay tuned for a blog post about the Tableland protocol and our future plans._
