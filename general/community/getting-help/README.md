### **Reporting Bugs**

Encountered something that isn't working right? It might be a good idea to submit a bug report to help the core Tableland developers fix it for you! Following these guidelines helps the Tableland core development team understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻, and find related reports 🔎. You can consult our bug report 101 guide if you are unfamilar with submitting GitHub Issues. Otherwise, feel free to submit a bug report in the repo in question!

### Feature Requests

Have an idea or suggestion for improving various aspects of Tableland's tech stack? If you have ideas for completely new features and/or minor improvements to existing functionality, we want to hear about it! If this is the case, you can create a feature request to help the core Tableland developers understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions 🔎.

Not familiar with GitHub issues for submitting feature requests? Checkout our Feature Requests 101 page for tips and tricks on creating feature requests as issues.

### **Managing Issues**

#### Discussions, Bugs, and Enhancements

A lot of items that come in as Issues are not bugs or feature requests, they’re questions or discussions. A lot of these questions can be answered by anyone on the internet; they’re not exclusive to this project. For feedback like this we recommend pointer users to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). It’s a great place where people can get all kinds of help, whether it is about using this project or just about any software-related topics.

The general guide is that GitHub Issues is best for things that have a definition of "done": they can be fixed, added, resolved, have a stake driven through its heart or otherwise laid to rest. For things where there isn't a clear goal or end state, where you want to debate theory, or ask questions, forums, Twitter, and other platforms are the way to go. We should encourage people to use the best channel for their required feedback. Sometimes, it is a good idea to jump into Discord and find out:

#### Ambiguous Issues

The whole point of Issues is that they are things that need to be fixed, implemented or completed in some fashion. But there are classes of things that get reported that are undefined or indistinct, there is no way to complete them or simply are chores that will never be done.

When a report comes in that looks like this, we will ask the original author of the Issue to clarify what "done" would look like to them. We can and will help with this process if you're unsure. But if the goal remains undefined or, in the maintainers' estimation, is unachievable, we will close the Issue.

#### **Abandoned Issues**

Issues are a way for the users and the maintainers of a project to communicate and cooperate towards goals. If the maintainers can't get the information they need to resolve something, an Issue can just sit, get lost in the shuffle and never move forward. We also understand that people have busy lives and sometimes they simply can't get back to us or have forgotten the context of an Issue.

In order to focus the maintainers' attention on making progress, we will mark issues with the `more-information-needed` label when the maintainers have a question. If we don’t receive a response from the original author within a week, we'll give a gentle reminder. If we still haven't received a response within 30 days, we will close the Issue.
