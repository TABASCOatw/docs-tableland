# Feature Requests 101

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please **perform a cursory search** in the relevant repo to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. In the end, you might find out that you don't need to create one at all! When you _are_ creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the feature request template in the repo in question, and include the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

### How do I submit a (good) enhancement suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined you need to create an issue, create one by providing the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out what the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to others and isn't something that can or should be implemented elsewhere.
* **List some other tools or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version you're using.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**
