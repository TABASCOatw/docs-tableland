# What is Tableland?

Textile is excited to be launching a whole new way to improve the decentralized metadata layer for NFTs. We're launching a new protocol that will allow collectors and creators to add new value to existing NFTs or develop novel NFTs in totally new ways. ETHDenver is the community's very first look at this new network. It is quite literally a relational table (foreign keys and joins) protocol for web3.

Imagine storing everything from tokenURI metadata, to NFT extensions, to DAO role-based tools, in relational tables. Tables can be owned and controlled by anyone on the ETH network, plus they come with built-in NFT access control super powers.

The MVP we are launching this week is the gateway for devs to create and use tables from ETH. We also have $15k in bounties to throw at you, plus a ton of super secret drops and perks for folks who are among the earliest to build on the protocol.
