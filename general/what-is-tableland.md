# What is Tableland?

> Tableland isn't a new database — it’s just Web3-native relational tables.

Textile is excited to be launching a whole new way to improve the decentralized metadata layer for NFTs. We're launching a new protocol that will allow collectors and creators to add new value to existing NFTs or develop novel NFTs in totally new ways. February 2022 was the community's very first look at this new network. It is quite literally a relational table (foreign keys and joins) protocol for web3.

Imagine storing everything from `tokenURI` metadata, to NFT extensions, to DAO role-based tools, in relational tables. Tables can be owned and controlled by anyone on the ETH network, plus they come with built-in NFT access control super powers.

The MVP that was launched in February 2022 is comprised of a gateway for devs to create and use tables from ETH. Post launch, upwards of $15k in bounties are being made available to hackers and developer who want to build on Tableland. Plus, stay tuned for a ton of super secret drops and perks for folks who are among the earliest to build on the protocol.

Read about our current plans by digging into our **Roadmap** below. We've also got plenty of information about community resources, and if you're already ready to start building on Tableland, check out our sections for **Building** and **Developers** on the left!
