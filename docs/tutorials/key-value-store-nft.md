This tutorial walks through how to build a novel, custom database with any smart contract. Create your own access control rules, multi-user write/sharing, ownership models, and more. We start by building a simple key-value store that could power a JSON document store, a collaborative document editor, a simple indexing engine, etc. Then, we write a custom Solidity contract that abstracts Tableland and allows users to create custom key-value stores by minting them as new NFTS.
