This tutorial shows how to build a simple game of hangman where each game is minted as an NFT; other players can play the NFT game by submitting a target and their letter guess. The app is built with smart contracts for game state / logic and IPFS for the React app / NFT visuals (using [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/)).
