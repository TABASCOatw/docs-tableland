title: Allow all controller
description: Provision access so that any account can perform any action on a table.

The allow all controller enables exactly as it soundsâ€”allow _anyone_ to do _anything_ on a table. It is the definition of fully opening up for collaborative data, but keep in mind that this includes inserting, updating, and deleting data on any row/column. Thus, it's more common to add some addition logic checks before returning the `TablelandPolicy`; if those checks don't pass, perhaps you return a different policy.

  function getPolicy(
    address,
    uint256
  ) public payable override returns (TablelandPolicy memory) {
    // Return allow-all policy
    return
      TablelandPolicy({
        allowInsert: true,
        allowUpdate: true,
        allowDelete: true,

      });
  }
}
