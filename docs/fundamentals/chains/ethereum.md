Ethereum and its EVM is what drives Tableland's approach for chain compatibility. With its data and network hardness, it's a great case for many projects, but not all use cases can occur here due to cost and throughput constraints.

## Overview

Ethereum is the most popular and secure smart contract blockchain. All L2 solutions are built on top of Ethereum and run its virtual machine, called the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/#top). Transaction costs are much higher on Ethereum and take longer to get included in a block, so many applications use L2s, depending on the use case.

Because of its security, data can be viewed as more valuable on this chain. A highly secure, battle-tested environment translates to greater reliability, so applications may choose to pay a premium for this. Thus, deploying tables here is best used in higher value use cases and/or if on-chain access controls _specific to Ethereum_ are needed (e.g., verifying ownership of an Ethereum-based NFT).

#### Getting testnet funds

1. Request testnet Ether from a faucet noted above (e.g., [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/) or [here](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)).
2. Move the ETH from Ethereum to Optimism at [https://app.optimism.io/bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge)â€”i.e., select "ETH" or any other ERC20 tokens that exist on Ethereum Goerli that can be bridged.
