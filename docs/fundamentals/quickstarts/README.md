All database mutating statements are on-chain actions. If you're using the SDK or CLI, much of the blockchain and smart contract specifics are abstracted away from the developer experience. If you're a web3 or smart contract developer, you're already familiar with what on-chain transactions require.

## Prerequisites

There are two things every developer will need if they are trying to use Tableland:

- **Wallet**: You'll need to set up an account, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for browser wallet-based connections. You'll use your EVM account to create and write to tables across any of the networks Tableland is live on.
- **Funds**: If you want to create or write to a table, it requires an on-chain transactionâ€”you need to own currency in the native chain's denomination if you want to make database state changes.

:::tip
If you're developing on a testnet, you should get testnet currency, and the way to do this depends on the chain you're using. Check out the [chain selection documentation](/fundamentals/chains/#choosing-a-chain) for how to use testnet faucets and get fake currency.

Once you're ready to go, you can dive into any of the following:
