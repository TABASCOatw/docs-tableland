Tableland is a permissionless network where anyone can run and operate their own node. This page walks through how to run your own node, including hardware requirements, installation steps, and common questions.

:::caution

This page is a work in progress, but you can run your own Tableland node using the [`go-tableland`](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/go-tableland) code. Deeper documentation is coming soon, and if you're interested in discussing more about running Tableland nodes, reach out on [Discord and `#contact-team`](https://discord.com/invite/dc8EBEhGbg).
