## Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a rollup scaling solution that works by [batching transactions](https://arbiscan.io/batches) from L2 to L1 at various intervals. Off-chain transactions happen much more frequently and allow for very low costs and fast transaction confirmation times. Arbitrum operates a network of EVM-compatible nodes and uses fraud proofs to validate if the off-chain transaction are valid, doing so in a way that inherits Ethereumâ€™s security.

One key difference to note between Arbitrum and Optimism is that Arbitrum uses multi-round fraud proofs and single transaction disputes. This differs from single-round fraud proofs (e.g., Optimism) that execute the _entire rollup_ on Ethereum if a challenge is made.
