title: Type conversion
description: Openly readable tables by your applications.
synopsis: Reading from tables is entirely open (for anyone), allowing for true composability. Write SQL qeuries—but with some limitations that are due to the nature of decentralized networks and deterministic requirements.
keywords:
  - write to table
  - mutate table

Tableland supports a subset of SQLite types. When working in JavaScript, these types are converted to the Tableland requirements. Additionally, any object that implements a `toSQL` method can also be used.

| `Number`         | `INTEGER` | Tableland supports 64-bit signed INTEGERs internally, and we mostly support [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) on the client side. These values will be converted to INTEGERs. Note that Javascript integer's are safe up to [MAX_SAFE_INTEGER](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) $(2^{53} – 1)$. |
| `String`         | `TEXT`    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `ArrayBuffer`    | `BLOB`    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Booleans         | `INTEGER` | Booleans will be turned into integers where 1 is `true` and 0 is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Date`           | `INTEGER` | Dates are converted to their UNIX timestamp representation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Object` or JSON | `TEXT`    | A plain old JavaScript object ([POGO](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/pojo)) that can be converted to JSON strings will be converted to JSON and inserted as `TEXT`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
