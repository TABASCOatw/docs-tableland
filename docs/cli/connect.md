title: Connecting to Tableland
description: Access the Tableland network by first connecting to the base chain.
synopsis: Tableland is an extension of the chains it supports. Namely, every table creation and write occurs through on-chain actions, so it is a requirement for every developer to connect and interact with a supported blockchain. From there, reads happen off-chain by way of directly accessing the Tableland node network.
keywords:
  - read table
  - SQL query
