## Synopsis

This general API specification is used to automatically generate clients and backend services; it should be used as the primary source of truth for Validator APIs. This specification is a living document, and as such, may be updated over time. Proposals for the addition of API features and fixes may be submitted by the Tableland community over time. These proposals will be evaluated for technical feasibility, utility to the community, and longer-term sustainability.
