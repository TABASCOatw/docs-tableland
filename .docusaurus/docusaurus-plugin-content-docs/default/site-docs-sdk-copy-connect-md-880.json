    "synopsis": "Tableland is an extension of the chains it supports. Namely, every table creation and write occurs through on-chain actions, so it is a requirement for every developer to connect and interact with a supported blockchain. From there, reads happen off-chain by way of directly accessing the Tableland node network.",
