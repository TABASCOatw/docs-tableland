## Background

This repository hosts the Tableland protocol specifications. The following label system is used to help identify the current state of each spec:

- ![wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square) → A work-in-progress. It may be used to describe an idea before actually committing to a full draft of the spec.
- ![draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-yellow.svg?style=flat-square) → A draft that is ready to review and implementable.
- ![stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) → A spec that has been adopted (implemented). It might be improved but should not change fundamentally.

## Index

### [SQL specification](specs/sql/)

These specs define the SQL language compliant with the Tableland protocol. It is a subset of the [SQLite SQL language specification](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html), with additional constraints specific to Tableland operations. It does omit many features while at the same time adds a few features of its own.
