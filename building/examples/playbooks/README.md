Every NFT project needs metadata, and Tableland is ideally suited to handle this extremely important job. Check out our NFT Metadata Playbook for details:

[nft-metadata.md](nft-metadata.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Are you looking for a solution for storing key/value data on Tableland? Look no further than our Key Value Storage Playbook:

{% content-ref url="key-value-storage.md" %}

Did you know it is possible to "lock" the state of a table, effectively rendering it immutable forever? Find out more in our short guide to Immutable Tables:

{% content-ref url="immutable-tables.md" %}
