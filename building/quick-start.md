# Quick Start

## Get Access

For now, Tableland API requests are authenticated by ETH address. Any request that doesn't include a self-signed access token that is tied to a per-registered ETH address will return an error.

You can gain access to the Tableland MVP by joining our Discord. While you're there, don't forget to say hello in the `#ðŸ‘‹-intros` channel! Oh, and welcome to the community!

{% hint style="info" %}
Tableland is currently in private beta, so to join youâ€™ll need to do a few more steps! Having trouble getting access? One of the core Tableland developer team members will be happy to help. Just ask in #general or #support!
{% endhint %}

Once you've joined the Discord server and gone through the validation steps, you can sign up for API access by letting us know if you are hacking at ETH Denver in the `#ðŸ’»-ethden-lounge` channel (follow the instructions in the comment and react with the :gem: emoji). This will set you up with the _Creator_ role.

You should now find two new channels that are visible to you in the `#Tableland` category. Congrats, you are now a Tableland Creator :muscle:.

Next, jump into the `#ðŸŽŸ-creator-whitelist` channel and post your ETH public address. It should look something like this:

```bash
0xbAb12215Ed94713A290e0c618fa8177fAb5eFd2D
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only ever share you _public_ address. We will never DM you and we will never ask you for your secrets, private keys, passwords, or phrases. Be diligent, and report scammers and spammers.
{% endhint %}

That's it! Your ETH address will be added to the access control list shortly. Youâ€™ll be able to use `#ðŸ”©-creator-chat` to share your project, find collaborators, learn from others, ask technical questions, or let us know about any issues you run into. We'll also be posting periodic updates in the `#ðŸš¥-creator-updates`, so stay tuned!

## Play with our Terminal

The best way to interact and play with our API is to use our official playground tools. You can test out a simple interactive terminal for querying tables on Tableland below.

Or jump on over to [our website](https://tableland.xyz) where you can play with our integrated testnet Terminal. Finally, you can play with this Javascript console-based environment to learn how to use the Javascript SDK.

## Build with our SDK

The best way to _build on_ Tableland is to use our official Typescript/Javascript client. You can install this via `npm` or `yarn`. You can also pull the ESM build via `cdn.skypack.dev` or other means. For details and code snippets to get you going quickly, jump on over to our Javascript SDK guide.

## Explore with our API

If raw REST and RPC APIs are more your thing, then you might be more comfortable digging into our raw APIs. You can find API specs, command line examples, and more in our Remote API guide.
