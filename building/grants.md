Tableland aims to sponsor experienced developers to help facilitate the growth and development of the protocol & community. Grant work should be approved before starting (except those tied to events with external rules). If you would like to begin work on a Grant, open a support ticket on the [Tableland Discord](https://discord.gg/hpd5WWn4Ys) and outline your plan. Have a project or idea you want to explore but don't see an opportunity to match? Get in touch and let us know!
